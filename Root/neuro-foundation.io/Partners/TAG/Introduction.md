Trust Anchor Group 
=====================

TAG, short for [Trust Anchor Group](https://trustanchorgroup.com), is a Swedish company focusing 
on providing technology for creating smart societies, as well as helping its clients to *tokenize*
physical and digital assets. TAG is the original provider of the technology now published open source 
and forming the basis for Neuro-Foundation. [TAG technologies](TAG%20Technologies.pdf) include 
technologies such as:

* The next-generation distributed [Neuro-Ledger(R)](/Papers/Neuro-Ledger,%20Executive%20Summary.pdf),
  enabling global content scalability, as well as protection of privacy and confidentiality.

* The [Neuron(R)](https://lab.tagroot.io/Documentation/Index.md), a *broker* enabling distributed
  interoperation over the Internet. It is the cornerstone of creating open, interoperable and yet 
  secure networks for smart societies over the Internet, where ownership of information is protected.

* [eDaler(R)](Papers/Neuro-Payment%20architecture.pdf) forms the basis for *micro transactions* over 
  federated Neuron(R) networks.

* [Neuro-Exchange^TM](https://neuro-exchange.com/) for online trading of
